At some point I thought about how I could rate at 50% the gambles that had a 50% chance of something positive when the negatives were not too great. I rated gambles with higher potential payoffs higher. Any positive payoff lower than 50% chance was not very attractive to me. So the higher the payoff and the higher the percentage chance for the higher payoff got into the upper half of the scale. This was 5 or 7 and more than 50%.,"None of the faces were unpleasant. Average people got at the 50% mark. A few people I did not like their expressions or adornments. There were some very pretty young women of all races who I rated much higher. There were pleasant looking middle aged women who I rated higher.  A few men appealed to me. Many of the men however had expressions that seemed phony or not straightforward in a way that I can't quite pin down, or else I just couldn't rank them sequentially, or I'm not really sure.
