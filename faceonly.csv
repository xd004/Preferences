Each gamble is an uncertain bet that you might make in a casino or with a friend. The gambles are shown in a pie chart. Imagine an “arrow” is spun and it has an equal chance of stopping anywhere on the circle. When it stops it points to the payoff you receive. This “pie” is divided into 3 equal “slices,” meaning that you have an equal chance of about 1/3 or 33% of winning or losing the dollar amounts shown in the picture.
